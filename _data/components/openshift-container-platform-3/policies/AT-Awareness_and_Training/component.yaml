        For organizations requiring system operators to receive certifications
        or training on components for which they have privileged (administrator)
        access, training and certification programs are available for OpenShift.
        In addition to providing training information, these courses may be
        helpful in inspiring minimal knowledge requirements for staff
        performing the role of OpenShift Administrator.
