        <OpenShift will log events to standardized files, however automatic
        notification (outside of generating  audit data) is not possible. As an
        OpenShift Container Platform cluster administrator, you can deploy the
        EFK stack to aggregate logs for a range of OpenShift Container Platform
        services and setup alerting.

        Application developers can view the logs of the projects for which they
        have view access. The EFK stack aggregates logs from hosts and
        applications, whether coming from multiple containers or even deleted
        pods.

        'Authorization policies determine whether a user is allowed to perform
        a given action within an OpenShift project. This allows platform
        administrators to use policy to control who has various access levels
        to the OpenShift Container Platform itself and all projects. It also
        allows developers to use local policy to control who has access to
        their projects. Note that authorization is a separate step from
        authentication, which is more about determining the identity of who
        is taking the action.

        can be found in the OpenShift Architecture documentation:

        specific details on how the authorization policy has been
