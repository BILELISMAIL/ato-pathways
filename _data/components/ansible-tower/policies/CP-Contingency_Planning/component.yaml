        'As a procedural control, the process of backing up Ansible Tower
        is outside the scope of a configuration guide.

        The customer will be responsible for conducting daily incremental and
        weekly full backups of user-level information contained in the
        information system. Additional FedRAMP requirements and guidance include
        maintaining at least three backup copies of user-level information (at
        least one of which is available online) or provides an equivalent

        user-level information occures, and how three backup copies are
        maintained.
